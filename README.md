A command line based task tracker written with node js. So, you will need to install node first
if you don't have node in your pc.
p.s. I'm a beginner so my code won't be looking too clean.
Run the following commands to perform basic task tracker functions.

To add a task run - node app.js add "task"

To update the task with a specific id run - node app.js update 1 "task_updated"

To delete a task with id run - node app.js delete 1 

To list all the tasks in the file run - node app.js list

To list the tasks with specific status (todo, done or progress) run - node app.js list todo
    here the tasks are added with a default todo status 

To mark or change the status of a task run - node app.js mark-done 1
                                           - node app.js mark-in-progress 1
